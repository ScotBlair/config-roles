- Step 1<br />
Navigate to the "Agents" tab, click on "Roles" then "Add New Role."<br />

- Step 2<br />
In the area that says "Name," give your role a name.  I have chosen "Supreme Admin."  Now select the "Permissions" tab.<br />

- Step 3<br />
Assign what permissions you want your role to have. I want a Supreme Admin to have full permissions, so I check all the boxes, including the ones in the "Tasks" and "Knowledge" tabs.  A lesser role, of course, is not going to have all of these permissions checked.  Finish by clicking "Add Role."<br />
